Complex algorithms can bring headaches from time to time. For example, they can be tricky to debug and analyze when the miss ratio is high. Moreover, complexity means CPU cycles are needed to make the decisions. </p> <p>On the flip side, simpler eviction methods usually do an excellent job of providing good predictability and throughput.  For example, the Apache traffic server uses FIFO, MemC3 uses CLOCK, and Segcache uses FIFO-Merge eviction algorithms.  It's crucial to note that while these approaches excel in throughput, some compromise on cache efficiency. </p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/12/17/sieve-is-simpler-than-lru/#meet-sieve","title":"Meet SIEVE","text":"<p>SIEVE is a cache eviction algorithm that decides what to keep in the cache and what to discard.

SIEVE requires only one queue and one pointer called \"hand\".  The queue maintains the insertion order between objects. Each object in the queue uses one bit to track the visited/non-visited status. The hand points to the next eviction candidate in the cache and moves from the tail to the head. </p> <p>SIEVE operations. A cache hit changes the visited bit of the accessed object to 1. SIEVE does not need to perform any operation for a popular object whose visited bit is already set.  During a cache miss, SIEVE examines the object pointed by the hand. If it has been visited, the visited bit is reset, and the hand moves to the next position (the retained object stays in the original position of the queue).  It continues this process until it encounters an object with the visited bit being 0 and evicts it. After the eviction, the hand points to the next position (the previous object in the queue). While an evicted object is in the middle of the queue most of the time, a new object is always inserted into the head of the queue.</p> An illustration of SIEVE <p>SIEVE vs. CLOCK At first glance, SIEVE is similar to CLOCK/Second Chance/FIFO-Reinsertion - Note that they are different implementations of the same eviction algorithm. Each algorithm maintains a queue in which each object is associated with a visited bit to track its access status.  Visited objects are retained (also called \"survived\") during an eviction. Notably, new objects are inserted at the head of the queue in both SIEVE and FIFO-Reinsertion.  However, the hand in SIEVE moves from the tail to the head over time, whereas the hand in FIFO-Reinsertion stays at the tail.  The key difference is where a retained object is kept. SIEVE keeps it in the old position, while FIFO-Reinsertion inserts it at the head, together with newly inserted objects.</p> SIEVE vs. FIFO-Reinsertion <p>See the sieve cache implementation code at the end of this blog post for a detailed example. </p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/12/17/sieve-is-simpler-than-lru/#performance","title":"Performance","text":"<p>We evaluate SIEVE to answer the following questions:</p> <ul> <li>Does SIEVE have higher efficiency than state-of-the-art cache eviction algorithms?</li> <li>Is SIEVE simpler than other algorithms?</li> <li>Can SIEVE improve a cache's throughput and scalability?</li> </ul> <p>In this blog post, we only show part of our evaluation results.

The whiskers on the boxplots are defined using p10 and p90, allowing us to disregard extreme data and concentrate on the typical cases. SIEVE demonstrates the most significant reductions across nearly all percentiles.  For example, SIEVE reduces FIFO's miss ratio by more than 42% on 10% of the traces (top whisker), with a mean of 21% on one of the largest CDN datasets.  As a comparison, all other algorithms have smaller reductions on this dataset. Compared to advanced algorithms, e.g., ARC, SIEVE reduces ARC miss ratio by up to 63.2% with a mean of 1.5%.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/12/17/sieve-is-simpler-than-lru/#simplicity","title":"Simplicity","text":"<p>SIEVE is very simple.

However, SIEVE sometimes shows a miss ratio higher than LRU. The primary reason for this discrepancy is that SIEVE is not scan-resistant. In block cache workloads, which frequently feature scans, popular objects often intermingle with objects from scans. Consequently, both objects are rapidly evicted after insertion. Note that we made a mistake and used \"scan-resistant\" to mean something else. For the traditional sense of scans (larger than cache size), SIEVE is scan-resistant.  </p> <p>Since SIEVE does not use a ghost cache \u2014 a shadow cache that keeps track of recently evicted items to make smarter future eviction decisions \u2014 it cannot recognize the popular objects when they are requested again. This problem is less severe on the large cache size, but when the cache size is small, we observe that having a ghost is critical to be scan-resistant.</p> <p>Marc's latest blog post explored making sieve scan-resistant by adding a small counter for each item.  It shows some wins and losses on different workloads. </p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/12/17/sieve-is-simpler-than-lru/#wed-love-to-hear-from-you","title":"We'd Love to Hear from you","text":"<p>As we wrap up this blog post, we would like to give a big shoutout to the people and organizations that open-sourced and shared the traces.
